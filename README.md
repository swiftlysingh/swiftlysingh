I am **Pushpinder Pal Singh**, **a computer engineering sophomore at Netaji Subhas University of Technology**, New Delhi. I am an iOS developer and have been developing apps for more than 12 months now. I love contributing to Open Source Projects. To me, open source is the final frontier in tech. And contributing to opensource makes me feel that my code and documentation will matter in a bigger picture. I have been contributing to opensource for about a year now. Due to my love for Open Source Software, I am learning to contribute to the Linux Kernel. Apart from iOS and Linux Kernel I also would love to do something in the Data Science field.
