I am **Pushpinder Pal Singh, a pre-final year computer engineering (B.E.) student at the Netaji Subhas University of Technology, New Delhi.** I am expected to graduate in 2022. I am an iOS developer and have been developing apps for more than 12 months now.Â **I love contributing to Open Source.** My app SpaceDash, which is on the App Store, and is completely open-source on Github. We are adding more features are being added every week, you can see my app on App Store and Github by searching SpaceDash. Apart from iOS I love playing with computers and servers. I also have my own homelab running several services for me and my family. **I find networking, dev ops and cyber security extremely fun and fulfilling.**
